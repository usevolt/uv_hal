/// @file: A terminal interface which can be used over UART or CAN bus.
/// HAL layer takes care of parsing and redirecting the messages over UART or CAN.
/// User program needs to define all possible commands and register a callback function
/// which executes the received command from the user.
///
/// Some commands common for all CANopen based controllers are already defined in hal_terminal.c
/// These include entering ISP-mode and resetting the mcu.
/// The common commands cannot be disabled, but creating a application level command with the same
/// command name causes terminal to overwrite the common command.
///
/// If CONFIG_TERMINAL_DEDICATED_CALLBACKS is enabled, every command takes their own callback function.
/// This also changes how the arguments are passed to the callbacks. If CONFIG_TERMINAL_DEDICATED_CALLBACKS
/// is 1, the callbacks should be variadic functions which take va_list as a parameter.
/// The given arguments are parsed as integers by default, or as strings if enclosed with " " characters,
/// and pointers to them are given as va_arg arguments to the callback.
/// If CONFIG_TERMINAL_DEDICATED_CALLBACKS is 0, the arguments entered from the command line are not parsed
/// and the arguments are passed to the global callback function as strings.
///
/// NOTE: Note that in order to use UART or CAN as a terminal source, they have to be initialized
/// correctly. It doesn't matter if this module is initialized before them, but without initializing
/// the serial interfaces the terminal will never receive any characters sent to it.
